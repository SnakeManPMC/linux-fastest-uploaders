    Fastest Uploaders documentation 
    


BASIC INFORMATION

This is DayDream door, it will generate bulletins (ansi/ascii) for the bbs's
fastest uploaders, these uploaders are sorted in 0,1,2,3,4 and older day stats.
We refer in this document to the DD dir as "/home/bbs".    
    


INSTALLATION

copy binaries to /home/bbs/doors directory, insert the following line to the 
examine.dat file located in /home/bbs/confs/YOURCONFNAME/data directory:

    /home/bbs/doors/fastest %N
    
In our normal setup this is directly under the conftop line.    



CREATING BULLETINS

after the installation when your bbs receives the first uploads, you get file
pmcfasts.dat in the /home/bbs/doors directory, now run binary "fast" and it 
will read the pmcfasts.dat and create .gfx / .txt files for every day category.

after this is done, you can fiddle around the .gfx & .txt files usually copying
them to your bulletins dir and renaming them to bulletin.??.gfx etc.
